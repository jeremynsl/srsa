      We strive to connect Saskatchewan families affected by <span class="text-accent">Rett Syndrome</span> in order to build
      a supportive community that can listen, offer advice, and a shoulder to lean on. Our goal is to keep our families up
      on the latest research and treatments by sending them to learning conferences across Canada and the world. We also
      aim to raise public awareness and fundraise for research.

      1 in 10,000 people have Rett syndrome. Although considered rare, there are many families affected by RS in
      Saskatchewan. There are many researchers all over the world trying to improve the life of people with Rett
      Syndrome, whether with new therapies or symptomatic treatment and all the way to finding a way to reverse RS! With
      all this changing research, it can be difficult to wade through all the pertinent information. Finding trusted
      information is one step to simplifying this journey. There are national and international Rett syndrome
      conferences that help connect families with the research. Every year we send 1- 2 families to a conference on a
      reconnaissance mission of sorts, gather info and return home to tell everyone. As a banded community, we can make
      the tiresome information gathering easier.

        {
          question: 'What is Rett Syndrome?',
          answer:
            'Rett syndrome is a rare, non-inherited genetic neurological disorder that occurs almost exclusively in girls and leads to severe impairments, affecting nearly every aspect of the childâ€™s life: their ability to speak, walk, eat, and even breathe easily.',
        },
        {
          question: 'What causes Rett Syndrome?',
          answer:
            'It is caused by a mutation of the MecP2 gene on the X chromosome. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing.  Less than 1% of cases are inherited from parents - the vast majority is caused by genetic mutation.',
        },
        {
          question: 'What kind of symptoms are common?',
          answer:
            'RS symptom severity can vary widely in each individual but typically include: loss of purposeful hand use, loss of language, apraxia, breathing and lung problems, scoliosis, seizures, sleep problems and gastro intestinal problems.  Generally, individuals with Rett syndrome require 24/7 care.',
        },
      ],
      [
        {
          question: 'What about cognitive symptoms?',
          answer:
            'Cognitive assessment in children with Rett syndrome is complicated, but we know that they understand far more than they can communicate to us, evidenced by their bright and attentive eyes, and their ability to express a wide spectrum of moods and emotions.',
        },
        {
          question: 'What treatments are available?',
          answer: 'No clinically-proven treatments currently exist in North America.',
        },
        {
          question: 'What is on the horizon for Rett Syndrome Research?',
          answer:
            'The good news is that Rett Syndrome Research is an extremely vibrant space with plenty of exciting possibilities.  Explore some of those possibilities on our Resources page',
